# VAE for increasing the representativeness of luminescence spectra of carbon quantum dots
The work presents the results of using variational autoencoders to increase the representativeness of the dataset in the task of developing a multimodal photoluminescent nanosensor based on carbon dots for simultaneous determination of a number of parameters of multicomponent liquid media (heavy metal anions $Cu^{2+}$, $Ni^{2+}$, $Cr^{3+}$ and $NO_3^-$ and pH of aqueous solutions).
